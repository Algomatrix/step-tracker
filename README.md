# Step Tracker

## Overview
The Step Tracker App is an iOS application designed to provide users with an interactive and visually engaging way to track and monitor their step count and related health data. Leveraging Apple HealthKit, the app fetches step data and presents it through Apple's native charts API, enabling users to view their health information in a clear, graphical format. This enhances the user experience by making it easier to observe trends and understand their daily or weekly activity patterns compared to viewing plain numerical data.

## Features
- **HealthKit Integration**: Securely accesses users' step data from Apple HealthKit.
- **Graphical Data Representation**: Utilizes Apple's native charts API for a visually appealing display of step counts and related health information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of reviewing health data through intuitive chart-based visualizations.

## Future Goals
Our future vision for the Step Tracker App includes expanding its functionality to allow users to compare different sets of health data side by side. This will enable users to:
- Correlate their activity levels with changes in other health metrics (e.g., sleep patterns, heart rate, calorie intake).
- Identify trends over time that may inform their fitness or wellness decisions.
- Gain deeper insights into how their physical activity impacts overall health.

By integrating more comprehensive comparative analysis tools, the app aims to empower users to take control of their wellness journey with a broader perspective on their health data.

1. Clone or download the repository.
